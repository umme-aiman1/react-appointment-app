# React Appointment Booking App
This is a full-stack appointment booking app built with React and Firebase. Students can book appointments via a student portal, and teachers can view and manage appointments through a teacher portal. The app uses Firebase Authentication for secure login and Firestore for real-time data storage and updates.

## Features
Firebase Authentication: Secure login for students and teachers.
Student Portal: Students can book appointments with available teachers.
Teacher Portal: Teachers can view and manage the appointments booked by students in real time.
Firestore Integration: Appointments are stored and synced in real time with Firebase Firestore.

## Tech Stack
React: Frontend framework.
Firebase Authentication: For user authentication.
Firestore: For real-time database management.
React Router: For navigation between different views (Student and Teacher portals).

## Prerequisites

Node.js (v14 or later)
Firebase CLI (optional for Firebase project management)

## Future Improvements
Will make it responsive.
Add email notifications for appointment bookings.
Implement role-based access control.
Add pagination and filtering for appointments in the teacher portal.
Improve UI with better responsiveness and styling.
